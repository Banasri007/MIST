      <p>MIST, the Manipal Information Security Technology Club, is where curiosity meets code and chaos meets creativity. It’s a place where firewalls aren’t just a concept,they’re a challenge, where algorithms aren’t just lines on paper but puzzles that make you pull your hair out and cheer when they finally work. Walk into any session and you’ll find members huddled over laptops, debating the efficiency of sorting algorithms, testing encryption methods, or trying to patch vulnerabilities, all while sharing memes and energy drinks. Here, debugging isn’t just fixing errors - it’s an adventure, and every failed attempt is a lesson in persistence. MIST turns theory into practice, turning complex concepts like penetration testing, hashing, and network protocols into real experiences that push you beyond your comfort zone.</p>
      <p>But MIST is more than just tech; it’s about the people and the stories behind the screens. It’s in the late-night sessions when a faulty script threatens a project but ends in collective laughter, in the small triumphs of cracking a tricky algorithm, and in the camaraderie that grows during group discussions on ethical hacking or AI-driven security solutions. Mentorship flows as freely as coffee, and teamwork is coded into every project, from designing secure networks to simulating cyber-attacks. Being part of MIST means embracing challenges, learning to navigate complex security landscapes, and finding joy in the little victories—whether it’s successfully implementing a new firewall rule, optimizing an algorithm, or surviving a 48-hour hackathon. By the end, you don’t just gain technical knowledge - you gain friends, stories, and the resilience to tackle any digital puzzle life throws at you.</p>
